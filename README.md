# Origami

> Ancient technology used to transform 2D Objects into 3D Objects.

What was the first 3D object you can remember creating as a child?

Maybe it was a sculpture out of clay, or a new LEGO set.

For most, it was folding a piece of paper into a box, or paper plane.

We want to bring about that sense of play, and simplicity, into the metaverse, through origami.
